Welcome to net_mate!
net_mate is a web-application (MVC)framework. MVC divides your application
into three layers.

The Model layer represents your domain model (such as Account, Person, Post,
etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to your 
application. In net_mate, database-backed model classes are derived from 
NetMate::Model. Model allows you to present the data from database rows as
objects and decorate these data objects with business logic methods.

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and 
providing a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML.
Controllers load and manipulate models, and render view templates in order to 
generate the appropriate HTTP response. In net_mate, incoming requests are
routed by NetMate::Dispatcher to an appropriate controller, and controller
classes are derived from NetMate::Controller.

The View layer is composed of "templates" that are responsible for providing 
appropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can 
come in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded
Ruby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller
response. In net_mate, View generation is handled by erubis.
